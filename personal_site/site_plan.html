			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
                Arete is a gamified lifestyle and fitness tracker designed to help users pursue excellence. 
                It allows users to log daily habits such as workouts, sleep, water intake, and steps. 
                By consistently meeting daily goals, users earn points to "level up" their rank from a Rookie 
                to a Grandmaster, making self-improvement engaging and fun.
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
                The target audience includes fitness enthusiasts, self-improvement seekers, and anyone looking 
                to build better health habits through gamification. It is designed for users of all experience levels, 
                from beginners needing motivation to advanced users ("Elites") tracking detailed metrics.
            </p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
                The website utilizes JavaScript to create a responsive, server-less experience:
                <br>1. <strong>Local Storage Persistence:</strong> User accounts, login sessions, daily logs, and custom goals are saved directly to the browser's local storage, simulating a database.
                <br>2. <strong>Interactive Progress Bars:</strong> Dynamic visual indicators that fill up in real-time as users log their data.
                <br>3. <strong>Rank System Logic:</strong> A calculation engine that sums cumulative points to automatically update the user's rank badge (e.g., Rookie, Elite).
                <br>4. <strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Integration with Chart.js to render dynamic graphs showing the user's point history over time.
            </p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <p>
                The site uses a modern "Dark Mode" aesthetic to convey a sleek, high-tech feel suitable for a fitness application.

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			
			<h4>
				Heading Font: "Inter", sans-serif
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: "Inter", sans-serif
			</h4>
            <p>
                I chose <strong>Inter</strong> because it is a highly legible, modern typeface that works exceptionally well 
                on user interfaces and dashboards. Its clean lines complement the technical and data-driven nature 
                of the application.
            </p>

			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;">
				Pursue Your Excellence. Track your workouts, sleep, and nutrition. Level up your rank from Rookie to Grandmaster.
                Consistency is key to achieving Arete.
			</p>
			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored" style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; background-color: #1E293B; color: #fff;">
				Your current rank is <strong>Elite</strong>. You have earned 1,250 points today. 
                Keep pushing to reach the next milestone!
			</p>

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<nav style="background-color: #1E293B;">
				<a href="#" style="color: #2DD4BF;">Dashboard</a>
				<a href="#" style="color: white;">Goal Settings</a>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page (Dashboard)</h3>
			<p>
                The main dashboard serves as the command center for the user. It displays:
                <br>- <strong>Daily Motivation:</strong> A welcoming header.
                <br>- <strong>Status Cards:</strong> Total cumulative score, current user rank (with visual badge), and today's specific score.
                <br>- <strong>Metric Cards:</strong> Interactive cards for Workout, Sleep, Water, Steps, and Diet. These act as both data displays (progress bars) and buttons to open logging modals.
            </p>
			<h3>Page 2 (Goal Settings)</h3>
			<p>
                The Goal Settings page allows users to customize their experience. 
                <br>- <strong>Form Inputs:</strong> Users can set their daily targets (e.g., changing the workout goal from 30 mins to 60 mins).
                <br>- <strong>Difficulty Adjustment:</strong> Changing these goals affects how hard it is to earn maximum points, allowing the app to scale with the user's fitness level.
